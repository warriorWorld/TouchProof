# TouchProof

Sometimes, you want to hear a video rather than watch a video, and you put your phone in your pocket, but this will produce some unexpected touches. That is why I developed this app(I know YouTube provides a service for this, but it charges me a fee).
I did this by covering the entire screen. First, you click the icon twice, it will cover your entire screen, and you have to click twice after a long touch on this screen in order to unlock the screen. This prevented those unexpected touches.
